# W3EEIngredients
A list of alchemy ingredients that can be found in The Witcher 3: Enhanced Edition.

The spreadsheet can be viewed in Google Sheets [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JWS0vJsFHt_b7qmNWen_Q6NoqMwTNc7L/view?usp=sharing). However if you have access to a spreadsheet processor I recommend using that, since I don't think Google Sheets supports tables with headers.

The location information is pretty sparse right now, and there may be some ingredients missing. I'm trying to add things in as I play, but it would go a lot faster with some help.
